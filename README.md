# Density-Estimation-Using-a-Vibrating-Magnet--A-way-to-
A method for estimating medium density using the frequency response of a vibrating magnet, modeled through geometry-dependent added mass and fluid–structure coupling.This work was developed independently and aims to pave the base for An effective model or reinterpretation of known physics
